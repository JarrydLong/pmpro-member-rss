Create Member-Specific RSS Feeds for Paid Memberships Pro

== Description ==

Features:
* Create Member-Specific RSS Feeds for Paid Memberships Pro.
* View your RSS feeds on the Membership Account page.
* Add or remove as many RSS feed links as you want.

When the plugin is active, a link will be created under the Member Links section of every members' Membership Account page with the memberkey attached.
This special RSS feed will only contain membership restricted content which that user has access to, and filter out the rest (including unprotected posts).

Additional RSS feeds can be added with the pmpromrss_feeds filter. See example here: https://gist.github.com/messica/960b6365905a91a2a68b
